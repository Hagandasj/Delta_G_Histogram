# Description

This python script will convert current values from bin files to conductance data and create a Kernel Density Estimator plot of these values.

## Notes on Code

This file is outputting KDE plots. However, it takes about 30 minutes to generate these plots for a ~20 minute run at 100 kHz. I am hoping to have this optimized by this by Friday (3/8/2021).
