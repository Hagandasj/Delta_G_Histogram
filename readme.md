# Description

This python script will open and work with current and voltage values extracted from a bin file (generated from an Azopatch 200B). This script can plot the current data (in time) and histogram these values.

## Notes on Code

This file is outputting KDE plots, histogram plots, and scatter plots of the current data. This file is still being updated to be able to work the data in other ways.
